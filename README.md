StoryboardOFExample
===================

A barebones application showing how to mix native ios screens and and an openframeworks screen. It uses Apple Storyboards (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/general/conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/Storyboard.html) to connect all the screens together with segues- which are very handy. Most suited to a game style application- there is the main intro screen (uikit), an instructions screen (uikit), a 'game' screen (the OF app), and a finish screen (uikit).

Also handles all orientations for the different views, which has been a pain in the past with OF.
